# Current offline validation

Portfolio preparation date: **2026-11-02**.

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Bash syntax | Passed |
| ShellCheck 0.11.0 | Passed, no findings |
| Offline regression suite | 7 tests passed |
| Live laboratory/forensic/deployment re-run | Not performed during portfolio preparation |
| GitHub Actions | Workflow prepared; no remote result claimed |

Environment: Windows, Git Bash 5.2.37 and Python 3.12. The tests use synthetic local files and command tripwires for CLI-only calls. The GhostLogin assessment regression substitutes Nmap and SSH functions; it makes no actual connection.

These checks verify the behavior covered by the included tests. They do not prove full Linux tool compatibility, operational results, every error condition or production readiness. The selected historical lab image is separate evidence from the author's original report.
